# JS-8
A chip-8 emulator in javascript, and my first ever emulator !

## About
My emulator features basic chip-8 elements such as, sound, display, and controls.
This emulator has only implemented the basic original features of the chip-8, this means you won't be seeing shit like color or extended width.
It passes the cpu test and there are mostly no bugs (I hope), though compatibility is kinda a hit or miss; a few games are glitchy or just aren't playable.

This emulator is fairly portable and can be added to your website for whatever reason,,, though,,, there are way better alternatives,,,
To add it you just need:
- a `<canvas>` for display,
- an `<input type = file>` in order to insert a game rom.

(i aint gonna document the functions bitch i know u aint interested)
Anway if you really wanna add this to your site or whatever just look through the source and figure it out, cuz ion wanna do it, i promise it's readable :D

## How to Use
First, pick a rom and drag it into the rom input (if you have no roms, you can use the links at the bottom of the page)
Then you can just start playing :) The keyboard layout is:

`1 2 3 4
Q W E R
A S D F
Z X C V`

### Welp...
That's my emulator, i'll prolly work on more emulators cuz they're fun as fuckkk to make. Enjoy muthafuckas :D
